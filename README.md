# Pipeline-TEI2HTML
This repository contains the steps of the pipeline adapted to the needs of the MEGV project to process the result of the inference of a set of files from the ANOM COL-E collection.
The objective is:
- to compile with a python script all the .tei files resulting from the inference of the digital facsimiles of the archives by folder.
- correct these files and format them so that they are compatible with the XML format.
- to compile with a python script all the .tei files obtained per folder into a single TEI-XML file containing the entire corpus selected.
- from this TEI-XML file containing the selected corpus, obtain one or more html pages to facilitate an initial consultation of the results, by carrying out a full-text search.
